\section{Cryptography}

VPNs are often used to hide data from unauthorized readers or manipulation. To reach this goal cryptography 

\subsection{Cryptographic primitives}

\subsubsection{Data Integrity}

\subsection{Noise protocol framework}
All these new ideas like from CRYPTO conferences and modern AEAD Ciphers like ChaCha-poly

\section{Technology}
